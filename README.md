# Hate-Crime
This Python project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I analyzed hate crime victims to uncover relationships between variables through geography, prejudice, offense, and trends over time. 
# Objective 
My task is to perform  various analyses such as exploratory, linear regression, cluster, and time-series analysis of the hate crime data in order to derive insights to the following questions: 
1. What type of hate crimes are more frequent? 
2. Which groups were most affected by prejudice?
3. Which states had the most hate crimes reported? 
# Data
